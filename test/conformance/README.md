# Conformance Tests

Run the conformance suite:

```bash
pnpm conformance
```

To generate and serve the HTML report:

```bash
pnpm conformance:serve
```

Results are written to `test/conformance/results`, and the report is served at `http://localhost:8080`. `test/conformance/conformance.desc` stores the compiled descriptor set generated by `protoc`, which bundles the protobuf type metadata needed to load and validate conformance inputs.

## Acknowledgements

Conformance tests use the [cel-spec](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) and `protobuf/` submodules for upstream data and schemas. The `proto2pb/` and `proto3pb/` fixtures are copied from [cel-go](https://github.com/google/cel-go).
